This gap impedes the seamless transfer of knowledge crucial for the growth of aspiring professionals.

To address this challenge, our website serves as a dedicated platform for bridging the communication and experience gap between junior and senior students. By allowing users to share their internship and placement preparation details from both junior and senior perspectives, the website transforms into a repository of firsthand accounts, strategies, and advice.
